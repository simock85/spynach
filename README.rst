Spynach is a fast and lightweight WSGI Python framework for rapid prototyping of web applications, built upon
`Artichoke <http://bitbucket.org/axant/artichoke>`_.

Spynach has been developed with a syntax similar to the one of the Turbogears2 framework to permit to develop fast
and small web applications which can be quickly switched to a full stack framework when necessary.

Spynach ships packed with a bunch of useful tools:

- Ming (mongodb ODM)
- Jinja2 template engine
- WTForms for forms validation and rendering
